# Freshmore Coding Course

The DigitalWorld.ipynb file includes my own solutions to the class problem sets and a cross-subject project with Chemistry.

The FindTheGems.py file includes my code for a Kivy game, where the user wins by finding a certain amount of gems. This code may include some bugs due to the short development time phase I had.
