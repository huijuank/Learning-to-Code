# Python-Learning

## In this repo, I would like to collate some of the codes I have saved for my reference during my journey in learning Python.

### 1. Digital World

This is a course that I have taken during my Freshmore year (2019) in university, and documents some of the solutions I have come up with for some class problem sets and projects.

### 2. Machine Learning

This is a course that I have taken during my Junior year (2021) in university, and documents codes for 2 of my Homeworks.
